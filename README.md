## Github Battle: React (ES6+) App
This app takes the input of two Github user names, requests data from the Github API for each user, and rates them in popularity according to the data retrieved.

This app was originally created in ES5 by Tyler McGinnis, who operates the website ReactJSProgram.com.
As practice writing ES6+ syntax, I refactored the app entirely.
The app now implements *babel-preset-stage-3* in order to use the experimental *async/await* functions for API promises, as well as all other structural and syntactical features of ES6+.
